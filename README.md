# PyCalc
PyCalc is my attempt to make calculator in Python 3.x.x. GUI is made with tkinter.
Available options for now is addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. Besides those four operations, you can pop last digit and clear whole entry.
While choosing operation, the symbol is saved and variable, so the program knows which equasion to do when you choose "equal" sign.
